# Realtime Object Detector with Webcam
A beginner-friendly Python project that performs real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLO model and your webcam.
The program captures video frames live, runs them through the model, and draws bounding boxes + labels for detected objects (e.g., person, laptop, bottle, etc.).

#About this project
The goal of this project is to build a real-time object detector using a webcam feed. Instead of training a model from scratch, it uses pre-trained AI models such as:

YOLOv5 / YOLOv8

SSD MobileNet

These models can detect multiple objects in each frame with bounding boxes and class labels.
