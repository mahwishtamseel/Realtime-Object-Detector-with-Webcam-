# Realtime Object Detector with Webcam
A beginner-friendly Python project that performs real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLO model and your webcam.
The program captures video frames live, runs them through the model, and draws bounding boxes + labels for detected objects (e.g., person, laptop, bottle, etc.).
