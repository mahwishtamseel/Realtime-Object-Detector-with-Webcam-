# Realtime Object Detector with Webcam
A beginner-friendly Python project that performs real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLO model and your webcam.
The program captures video frames live, runs them through the model, and draws bounding boxes + labels for detected objects (e.g., person, laptop, bottle, etc.).

# About this project
The goal of this project is to build a real-time object detector using a webcam feed. Instead of training a model from scratch, it uses pre-trained AI models such as:

YOLOv5 / YOLOv8

SSD MobileNet

These models can detect multiple objects in each frame with bounding boxes and class labels.

# Features
Real-time object detection

Uses fast, pretrained deep learning models

simple, beginner friendly architecture

# Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV - for webcam access and drawing boxes

NumPy - handling arrays and frames

YOLO (Ultralytics) - pre-trained object detection model

# What I am learning

Difference between image classification and object detection

How pre-trained models work

How to load YOLO weights

How to read webcam input using cv2.VideoCapture()


How to run inference on each video frame

# Installations
Intall required packages
```pip install opencv-python numpy torch torchvision ultralytics```

# Work in progress
I am currently:

Setting up the environment

Learning how to run YOLO

Understanding webcam frame processing

Updates will be added soon!
